####Best Practices####

Your data won't mean anything if you can not effecitvely convey meaning to your audience. It is all to common that the best of data scientists spend 99% of their time on analysis and focus on data visualization as an after thought. We suggest that you follow data visualization gurus Stephanie Evergreen and Ann K. Emery's "Data Visualization Checklist" so you don't make the same mistake:

**Guidelines**

1. **Format Your Text Appropriately**

* Use a 6-12 word descriptive title is left-justified in upper left corner.
* Make sure your text has hierarchy. The most important items are at the top and in larger font with less important details below in smaller font.
* Avoid vertical or diagnal text, reading horizontally from left to right is much easier for your audience.
* Avoid redundant labeling. For example, if you have numeric gridlines AND data labels that reflect the numeric value, you are telling your reaing the same thing twice and cluttering your graph.

2. **Arrange Your Graph with Intentionality**

* Make sure data are arranged in a way that makes sense to your reader. For instance, if showing frequency, arrange your graph from greatest to least.

* **Only use two dimensions**. Please, please, please resist the urge to use any type of 3-D graph. Your reader already has a lot of their plate, don't add more!
